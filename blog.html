			<h2> new york city trip </h2>
			<img id="chelsea" src="nyc/chelsea.jpeg">
			<p> Recently, my boyfriend and I took a trip to New York City — one which was unfortunately cut short by the escalation of the COVID-19 outbreak. Things ran normally while we were there, but museums and restaurants were ordered to close not long after our return. The frenetic pace of the city stands in stark contrast to the isolation and quiet we now find ourselves in; I'm grateful to have these photos to look back on. </p> <p> <a href="nyc.html"> read more » </a> </p>

			<h2> my favorite breakfast sandwich </h2>
			<img id="sandwich" src="sandwich/sandwich.jpeg">
			<p>  I love spending time in coffeeshops — so much so, I think I can count the times I've studied in a library on one hand. One of my favorites is <a href="https://www.joebarseattle.com"> Joe Bar</a>, a tiny two-story café a few minutes' walk from my apartment. They serve toasts, crêpes, and, of course, coffee, but my favorite thing on the menu is an unassuming egg-and-croissant sandwich piled high with arugula. Since I'm not spending much time in coffeeshops these days (hopefully soon!), I thought I'd try making my own at home.</p>
