			<h2> my favorite breakfast sandwich </h2>
			<img id="sandwich" src="sandwich/sandwich.jpeg">
			<p>I love spending time in coffeeshops — so much so, I think I can count the times I've studied in a library on one hand. One of my favorites is <a href="https://www.joebarseattle.com"> Joe Bar</a>, a tiny two-story café minutes' walk from my apartment. They serve toasts, crêpes, and, of course, coffee, but my favorite thing on the menu is an unassuming egg-and-croissant sandwich piled high with arugula. Since I'm not spending much time in coffeeshops these days (hopefully soon!), I thought I'd try making my own at home.</p>
			<p> Something about the flavors in this sandwich work unprecedentedly well together: the flaky-buttery croissant, the richness of the egg, tangy goat cheese, and a slight, bitter crunch from the arugula. It's also really easy to make! You'll need:</p>
			<ul> 
				<li> one or two large eggs </li>
				<li> butter croissant, mine are from QFC</li>
				<li> big handful of some kind of leafy green — we had some spring mix that needed using, but arugula is my favorite</li>
				<li> goat cheese, or another spreadable cheese </li>
				<li> pat of butter </li>
				<li> splash of milk </li>
				<li> salt + pepper </li>
			</ul>

			<p> Halve your criossant crosswise and set it aside; whisk together eggs with salt, pepper, and milk. Melt butter in a pan over low-medium heat. Pour the omelette mixture into the pan as you begin toasting your croissant: they should be done at about the same time. As your egg cooks, gently fold up the sides as you would a crepe, then remove from heat and set aside. Spread the goat cheese along the bottom half of the croissant. Top with egg, then greens. </p>

			<p>Enjoy!</p>
